## How to install

`npm install`

## How to run

`node radio`

Note: You have to set an environment variable called `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` with a valid API key from YouTube for this to work. (For windows you can do something like: `SET YOUTUBE_API_KEY=mykeyhere && node radio`) More on that here: https://developers.google.com/youtube/
